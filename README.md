This demo web app is nothing but static HTML and JavaScript files. However, since it uses Ajax, you have to host it on a web server to make it work.

Live demo at http://stevesanderson.github.io/ko-custom-elems-test/

### Running it locally

If you have Node.js, open a terminal/command prompt in the same directory as this README file, then run:

    npm install -g http-server
    http-server

... then browse to http://localhost:8080/

Alternatively, configure any other web server to serve these files.
